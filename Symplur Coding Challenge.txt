Coding challenge: 

Given the attached CSV file representing a hierarchy of names, write a routine in PHP that reads all of this data, assembles it into an in-memory tree structure, and outputs this tree in pretty-printed JSON format.

Within the CSV file, the `id` column is the primary key for each row. The `parent_id` column refers to the ID of each row's parent.  `parent_id = 0` denotes top-level names.

The output should include names, IDs, and a listing of each row's direct descendants.  It should reflect the following structure:

[
    {
        "id": 7,
        "name": "A",
        "children": [
            {
                "id": 34,
                "name": "C",
                "children": [
                    {
                        "id": 11,
                        "name": "B",
                        "children": []
                    },
                    {
                        "id": 12,
                        "name": "D",
                        "children": [...]
                    }
                ]
            },
            ...
        ]
    },
    ...
]
